# I Need Help! Evaluating LLM’s Ability to Ask for Users’ Support: A Case Study on Text-to-SQL Generation
**TL;DR:** We propose a framework for LLMs to seek user support, design evaluation metrics to measure the trade-off between performance boost and user burden, and empirically assess this ability on Text-to-SQL generation.
